        <h1>My Favourite things</h1>
        <p>Here are some of characters that might make me be interested in be-friending someone</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Honest person</li>
            <li>Visionary person</li>
            <li>Some who who can master the art of self control</li>
            <li>A curious person</li>
            <li>Person who motivates and challenges you to improve in life goals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I do love trying to have a bite on meals from different cultures. Here are some of my favourite meals that you should also have a try</p>
        <ol>
            <li>炒饭-chǎofàn. Haha! I know you might be wondering what is this but is simply a chinese fried rice.</li>
            <li>Fufu- It is a dough like food mainly found in West African countries like Nigeria and Ghana. Fufu taste similiar like Ugali,stiff porridge made from white cornmeal or red millet, a staple food in Kenya.</li>
            <li>Well fried tilapia fish. This meal slaps hard when it goes with a combination of sukuma wiki(kales) and Ugali one of the best Kenyan dishes.</li>
            <li>Nyama choma and Pombe (Roasted meat and beer). This one of the most Kenyan delicacies that happens during informal social meet ups. The beer and the roasted meat helps one loosen up as they try and catch up with friends.</li>
        </ol>
